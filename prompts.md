## Development Process with AI

### 1. Initial Project Setup

**ChatGPT Prompt:**
```
I want to create a GitHub repository analyzer with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend. Help me plan the architecture and tech stack.
```
Used for:
- Deciding on project structure
- Choosing appropriate libraries
- Setting up the development environment

### 2. Frontend Development

**Claude Prompt:**
```
Help me implement a responsive dashboard using shadcn/ui components that shows GitHub repository analytics with the following features:
- Repository statistics
- Commit history visualization
- Language distribution
- Contributor analysis
```
Results:
- Implemented responsive UI components
- Created data visualization charts
- Set up theme switching functionality

**DeepSeek Prompt:**
```
Optimize the following React component for better performance and reusability:
[component code]
```
Results:
- Improved component structure
- Added proper TypeScript types
- Enhanced code reusability

### 3. Backend Implementation with FastAPI (Learning Journey)

As a beginner in FastAPI, AI assistance was crucial in understanding and implementing the backend:

**Initial FastAPI Setup (Claude):**
```
I'm new to FastAPI. Help me set up a basic FastAPI project structure with:
- proper folder organization
- database connection
- environment variables
- CORS configuration
```
Results:
- Learned FastAPI project structure
- Understood dependency injection
- Set up Supabase connection
- Configured CORS for frontend access

**Database Models (ChatGPT):**
```
Help me create SQLAlchemy models for storing:
- Repository analysis results
- Analysis history
- Repository metadata
Create the necessary migrations too.
```
Results:
- Learned SQLAlchemy model definition
- Created proper database schema
- Understood relationship between tables
- Implemented database migrations

**API Endpoints (Claude):**
```
Guide me through creating these FastAPI endpoints:
1. POST /api/analyze - for new repository analysis
2. GET /api/past-analyses - to fetch analysis history
3. DELETE /api/analysis/{id} - to remove analysis
Include error handling and validation.
```
Results:
- Learned FastAPI routing and path operations
- Implemented Pydantic models for validation
- Added proper error handling
- Understood async/await in FastAPI

**GitHub API Integration (DeepSeek):**
```
Show me how to integrate GitHub API with FastAPI to:
- Fetch repository details
- Get commit history
- Calculate language statistics
Use proper error handling and rate limiting.
```
Results:
- Learned to use PyGithub library
- Implemented API response caching
- Added rate limit handling
- Structured API response data

### 4. Data Visualization

**ChatGPT Prompt:**
```
Help me implement interactive charts using Recharts for showing:
- Commit activity over time
- Language distribution
- Contributor statistics
```
Results:
- Created responsive charts
- Implemented proper data formatting
- Added interactive tooltips

### 5. Authentication & Security

**DeepSeek Prompt:**
```
Review my API implementation and suggest security improvements for:
- API rate limiting
- Error handling
- Data validation
```
Results:
- Implemented proper validation
- Added rate limiting
- Enhanced error responses

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Chart Implementation
```typescript
// AI helped optimize this chart component
const LanguageChart = ({ data }) => {
  // Implementation details...
};
```

### Example 2: FastAPI Implementation Learning
```python
# Base FastAPI setup learned through AI guidance
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

app = FastAPI()

# CORS setup suggested by Claude
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Configured for development
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Pydantic models for validation (learned from ChatGPT)
class AnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    repo_url: str

class AnalysisResponse(BaseModel):
    repo_name: str
    stars: int
    forks: int
    total_commits: int
    languages: dict
    contributors: List[dict]

# Main analysis endpoint (developed with Claude's guidance)
@app.post("/api/analyze", response_model=AnalysisResponse)
async def analyze_repository(request: AnalysisRequest):
    try:
        # GitHub API integration (learned from DeepSeek)
        repo_data = await fetch_github_data(request.repo_url)
        
        # Store in database (SQLAlchemy usage learned from ChatGPT)
        analysis = await store_analysis(repo_data)
        
        return analysis
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```
